## What is it?

A native iOS template for rapid development using RHMAP. The template uses UI libs like the [SWRevealViewController](https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController) to have facebook like hamburger menu to demo [iOS FeedHenry SDK](https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-ios-sdk) features:

- perform cloud calls, 
- store data in the cloud using Mongo DB
- use a third party API to get location based weather data. 
 
Push notifications will be in a later release.

If you do not have access to a RHMAP instance, you can sign up for a free instance at [https://openshift.feedhenry.com/](https://openshift.feedhenry.com/).
